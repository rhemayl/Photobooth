why I made this project...
---

I made this project because going to photobooths with always one of my favourite things to do with friends, but they can sometimes be a bit expensive. I made this so that I can get the same effect at home too!!

how I made my project...
---

I started by first planning out the templates/filters I want, then added different features such as video, taking pictures and choosing template, then designed the layout and put everything together! I used CSS, HTML, JavaScript.


what I struggled with...
---

the whole thing basically was a huge challenge as I have never really made a project by myself with code before, let alone a whole website, so I had to search up how to do everything >.<

but the process was really fun and I definitely learnt so much! (learnt everything in the code from scratch)
